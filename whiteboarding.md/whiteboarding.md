# Module 3 Whiteboarding Exercises

## Problem 1: Breadth First Search on a Graph

Given the adjacency list below, how many friends would Joe visit if he were
trying to get to Jesse using Breadth-First Traversal?

NOTE: your function should return the number of friends visited, not including
Joe himself

```javascript
const adjacencyList = {
  'derek':['selam', 'dean'],
  'joe':['selam'],
  'selam': ['derek', 'joe', 'dean', 'evan'],
  'dean': ['derek', 'evan', 'selam'],
  'sam': ['jen'],
  'evan': ['selam', 'jesse', 'dean'],
  'jen':['sam', 'javier'],
  'javier':['jen'],
  'chris':[],
  'jesse': ['evan'],
};
```

## Problem 2: Depth First Search on a Graph

Given the adjacency list below, which friends would Joe visit if he were
trying to get to Jesse using Depth-First Traversal?

NOTE: your function should return a list of friends visited, not including Joe
himself.

```javascript
const adjacencyList = {
  'derek':['selam', 'dean'],
  'joe':['selam'],
  'selam': ['derek', 'joe', 'dean', 'evan'],
  'dean': ['derek', 'evan', 'selam'],
  'sam': ['jen'],
  'evan': ['selam', 'jesse', 'dean'],
  'jen':['sam', 'javier'],
  'javier':['jen'],
  'chris':[],
  'jesse': ['evan'],
};
```

## Problem 3: Path Sum of Binary Tree

Given the binary tree below and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf
path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
Return a boolean if you find a path.

Example:

pathSum(5, 22) where 5 is the root node and 22 is the sum => True
explanation - 5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22

```js
//       5
//      / \
//     4   8
//    /   / \
//   11  13  4
//  /  \      \
// 7    2      1
```

## Problem 4: Max Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
node down to the furthest leaf node.

## Problem 5: Find Ancestors of a Node

Given a binary tree, find the ancestors of the node of a particular value.

Root will be a root node of a binary search tree and `k` is an integer value of
a node whose ancestors you will need to find.

Example:
findAncestors(6, 10) => [6, 9, 12]

```js
  //   6
  //  / \
  // 4   9
  //   /  \
  //  8   12
  //      / \
  //     10  14
```

## Problem 6: Mirror image trees

Write a function that would return true if a binary tree is a mirror image of
another binary tree.

## Problem 7: Reverse a Linked List

Write a function that will reverse a singly linked list.
